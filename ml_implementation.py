                        - The Decision Tree model relies heavily on specific device models to predict the operating system, which aligns with the expectation that certain devices are exclusive to particular operating systems. This insight may be less useful for predicting OS in future data if new devices are introduced, as it depends on specific device information rather than more generalized features.

                        - The three engagement levels appear as clusters with clear separations, indicating that the SVM model was successful in distinguishing between low, medium, and high engagement users based on App Usage Time, Screen On Time, and Battery Drain. Each engagement level forms a distinct cluster, with some overlap between adjacent levels.

                    3. `Conclusion`
                        - The SVM model is effective in segmenting users into distinct engagement levels. This could be valuable for creating tailored experiences based on engagement patterns, as well as for targeted marketing or user retention strategies. However, the presence of slight overlaps suggests that some users' behaviors fall near the boundaries of engagement categories, which could result in occasional misclassification.
